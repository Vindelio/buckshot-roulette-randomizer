# Buckshot Roulette Random Player Picker
[buckshot.graesberg.com](https://buckshot.graesberg.com)\
This project is a website designed to let you pick one of the players around the table completely at random. This includes yourself, though it is off by default, as I suspect you are not stupid enough to let a website decide if you should shoot yourself.

The site is based on the design of the "Jammer" item in the game, with slight changes made to support the new usecase.
