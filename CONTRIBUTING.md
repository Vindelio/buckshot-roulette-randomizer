## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Buckshot Roulette Randomizer Code of Conduct](https://git.graesberg.com/buckshot-roulette-randomizer/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <buckshot@graesberg.com>.

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://git.graesberg.com/buckshot-roulette-randomizer/issues) and the [Q&A section of Discussions](https://git.graesberg.com/buckshot-roulette-randomizer/discussions/categories/q-a) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Ask a question at [Q&A](https://git.graesberg.com/buckshot-roulette-randomizer/discussions/categories/q-a).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then try to answer you question as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs


#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://git.graesberg.com/buckshot-roulette-randomizer/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <buckshot@graesberg.com>.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://git.graesberg.com/buckshot-roulette-randomizer/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Buckshot Roulette Randomizer, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.


#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Perform a [search](https://git.graesberg.com/buckshot-roulette-randomizer/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

If you are planning on submitting changes YOU have made:
- Make sure that you are using the latest version of the code.
- Have fun! Coding is supposed to be fun, don't be scared if your code doesn't work 100%, just open a new issue and let someone else take care of it. This is a safe space to learn!

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://git.graesberg.com/buckshot-roulette-randomizer/issues).
Use the "Feature request" template when creating your issue

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.

If you want to submit code to create the enchanement yourself, then:
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and the built-in [screen recorder in GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) or [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Buckshot Roulette Randomizer users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
- Then read the [next section](#your-first-code-contribution) to learn how to contribute and create a pull request!

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution

## Styleguides
To maintain convention and readability across the codebase, please conform to the following styleguides:

### Code conventions
- The project is written in TypeScript, so make sure you conform to TypeScript best practices, e.g.
  - Make sure you create TypeScript files, i.e. ```.ts``` and ```.tsx``` rather than ```.js``` and ```.jsx```
  - Do your best to avoid using the ```any``` type, as this can create confusion and errors
- Indentation:
  - Indent with spaces
  - 2 spaces of indentation
- Use arrow funtions (```const _ = () => {}```) rather than regular ```function``` declarations
  - If your component only returns JSX, omit the ```{}``` for ```()```
    - Example: 
    ```ts
    const WrongComponent = () => {//❌ Do not do this
      return (                    //❌ Do not do this
        <>                        //❌ Do not do this
        // Your JSX component       ❌ Do not do this
        </>                       //❌ Do not do this
      )                           //❌ Do not do this
    }                             //❌ Do not do this

    const RightComponent = () => (//✅ Do this instead
      <>                          //✅ Do this instead
      // Your JSX component         ✅ Do this instead
      </>                         //✅ Do this instead
    )                             //✅ Do this instead
    ```
  - Exception: ```layout.tsx``` uses a regular function declaration. This is beacuse it was generated by next, and I am lazy
